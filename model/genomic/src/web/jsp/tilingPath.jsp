Whole genome tiling path primers for ChIP-Chip experiments in <i>D. melanogaster</i>.  The primers were designed to PCR-amplify 1000-1200 bp overlapping fragments of the release 4.0 genome excluding the transposable elements.  The amplimers were designed in such a way that a subset of amplimers, the "promotor" amplimers, are positioned adjacent to the 5' end of annotated genes.  Rana and Micklem (unpublished).
