The aim of <A href="http://www.indac.net">INDAC</A> is to produce a widely available and uniform set of array reagents so that microarray data collected from different studies may be more easily compared. INDAC has designed a set of 70mer long oligonucleotides to release 4.1 of the <I>D. melanogaster</I> genome. Oligos were designed using a custom implementation of <A href="http://berry.engin.umich.edu/oligoarray2">OligoArray2</A> developed by Dr David Kreil in the <A href="http://www.flychip.org.uk">FlyChip group</A>. Synthesis of the set by <A href="http://www.illumina.com">Illumina</A> began in April 2005.<BR>
<BR>
The genomic locations of these oligos are available in FlyMine and can be viewed graphically using the GBrowse genome viewer.
