       Building a simple query using the FlyMine query builder involves the following steps:
      </item>
      <item>
      Select the class from which you want to start your query, from
      the <ulink url= "manualClasschooser.xml">Class chooser.</ulink>  
      </item>
      <item>
       Select the classes and /or fields you wish to constrain using the ->
       constrain arrows. Specify your constraints in the right hand <ulink
       url= "manualConstraintslist.xml">constraints list.</ulink>    
      </item>
      <item>
       Select the classes and/or fields you wish to show in the results output
       using the 'show' buttons.  The classes/fields selected will appear in
       the <ulink url= "manualOutputfields.xml">output fields list.</ulink> 
      </item>
      <item>
       Press <ulink url= "manualShowresults.xml">show results</ulink> to view
       your results in the <ulink url= "manualResultdisplay.xml">results
       page</ulink> 
      </item>

   <section>
      <heading>Constraints</heading>
      <item>To select the subset of objects you want from a particular class
      you apply a constraint to the appropriate field.  For example if you
      want objects from the Gene class which have a particular name, you
      constrain the gene name field.  If you want objects from the Gene class
      which have a certain sequence length or range of sequence length, you
      constrain the seqLen field. If you are constraining a class field you
      will be given the option to constrain that class to any of the
      subclasses of that class.  e.g. The transcript class can be constrained
      to a number of subclasses of Transcript (e.g. primary transcript,
      processed transcript, tRNA etc.).</item>
