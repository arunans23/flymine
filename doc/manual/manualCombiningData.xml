    <title>Combining data from different classes</title>

    <para>Because of the relationships between the objects in the classes you
    may only need to constrain one class to retrieve a subset of items from
    another class. eg if you want all the genes from Drosophila, you only need
    to constrain the organism class to Drosophila to retrieve that subset of
    genes from the gene class. If you wish to know about the transcripts of a
    particular gene you would combine information from the Gene class and the
    Transcript class. By constraining the 'name' field of the gene class to a
    particular gene, you will only retrieve information from the transcripts
    class that relates to that gene (ie you do not need to apply the
    constraint to the transcripts class as well). This is because that
    particular gene object has a relationship to particular objects
    (instances) of the transcript class (ie those transcripts that are
    produced from that particular gene).</para>
