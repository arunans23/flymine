    <title>Selecting data from classes</title>

    <para>You can think of the classes as boxes containing lots of individual
    items (objects). To create a query you want certain items from certain
    boxes. You therefore have to select the boxes that require the items you
    want and constrain the boxes so that you only select the subset of items
    in the boxes that you require. To query FlyMine you therefore select the
    classes that hold the objects you require. Constraints can be applied to
    the objects contained in a class, so that only a certain subset of those
    objects which have the required characteristics are selected. For example
    the gene class contains a large number of genes (gene objects) from all
    the organisms represented in FlyMine. However you may only be interested
    in data related to one specific gene. You would therefore constrain the
    gene name field of the gene class to that of the required gene.</para>
