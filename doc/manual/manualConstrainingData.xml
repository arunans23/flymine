    <title>Constraining to subclasses</title>

    <para>Some classes are subdivided in to more specialised subclasses. For
    some queries you may only be interested in data relating to a particular
    subclass of a class. For example, you may only be interested in the tRNA
    transcripts. In these cases you need to constrain the class to the
    subclass that you require. The difference between this and the examples
    above is that you are constraining the actual class, rather than a field
    of a class.</para>
