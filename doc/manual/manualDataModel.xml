The FlyMine database is built using <ulink url =
"http://www.intermine.org"> InterMine</ulink>, an open-source data
warehouse system for integrating the data from many sources into one
object-based database. The FlyMine data model is generated by merging
existing and emerging ontologies and standards (e.g. MAGE, SO, PSI),
thus enabling data to be loaded from a variety of sources and
providing the flexibility to easily incorporate new data sources as
they appear. Additional FlyMine specific classes help link the
ontologies and provide classes relating to the evidence and source for
a particular piece of data.  To get the most out of querying FlyMine
it is useful to understand a bit about the underlying data model.
First of all it is useful to understand the concepts of <ulink url =
"manualCOF.xml">classes, objects and fields</ulink>.
