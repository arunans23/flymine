       <heading>The FlyMine Data Model</heading>
       <item>
The FlyMine database is based upon an object model.  The object model
has been created by merging existing ontologies and standards
including the Sequence Ontology, MAGE, and PSI (blah blah). Additional
FlyMine specific classes help link the ontologies and provide classes
relating to the evidence for a particular piece of data (needs
work!!).  To get the most out of querying FlyMine it is useful to
understand a bit about the underlying data model.  First of all it is
useful to understand the concepts of classes, objects and fields.
