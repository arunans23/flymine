    <title>The FlyMine Data Model</title>

        <para>The FlyMine database is built using <ulink
        url="http://www.intermine.org"> InterMine</ulink>, an open-source data
        warehouse system for integrating the data from many sources into one
        object-based database. The FlyMine data model is generated by merging
        existing and emerging ontologies and standards (e.g. MAGE, SO, PSI),
        thus enabling data to be loaded from a variety of sources and
        providing the flexibility to easily incorporate new data sources as
        they appear. Additional FlyMine specific classes help link the
        ontologies and provide classes relating to the evidence and source for
        a particular piece of data. To get the most out of querying FlyMine it
        is useful to understand a bit about the underlying data model. First
        of all it is useful to understand the concepts of <ulink
