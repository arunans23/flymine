  <title>Browsing FlyMine</title>


    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
          <para>There are two ways to browse the data in FlyMine:
          1. directly from the main query page or 2. through a query
          you construct yourself.</para>

          <title>1. Browsing directly</title> 

       <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>The FlyMine Browse search, accessible from the main
          query page (see screenshot below), allows you to quickly and
          directly access the data in FlyMine.  Entering any object
          identifier (such as a gene name or identifier) will take you
          straight to the details page for that object (see <ulink
          url="manualTemp1.xml">Object details pages.)</ulink>
          Wildcards are automatically attached to any text entered and
          so your search may match more than one object in the
          database.  In such a case a list of all matching objects is
          shown, from where you can access the object details
          page.</para>

        <title>2. Browsing from a query</title>
        
        <itemizedlist>
           <listitem>
            <para>Queries can be constructed using the FlyMine query
               builder in such a way that the results are browsable.
               If you select an entire class to 'show' in the output
               (as opposed to selecting attributes of a class, see
               screenshot below), your result will provide a link to a
               details page for the objects returned from that
               class. See <ulink url="manualObjectDetails.xml">Object
               details pages </ulink>for more details.</para>
