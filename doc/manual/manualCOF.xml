        <heading>Classes, Objects and Fields - the basics</heading>
        <item>Classes can be thought of as templates to describe information about a specific type of thing. Things which have similar properties belong to the same class.  For example in FlyMine there is a 'Gene' class.  The Gene class describes properties of genes.  The actual properties are known as fields.  The class is a holder for a set of fields that provide information about the 'thing'.  For example the Gene class has the fields name, residues etc.  An object is an actual member of a class (known as an 'instance' of that class). For example, the Notch gene is a member of the gene class. Every object of a class has the set of properties (fields) that describe that class, although some of these fields may be empty (ie. there may not be any data available for some fields).  The classes in the FlyMine data model form a hierarchy with classes lower down the hierarchy being specialisations of classes higher up. For example, the transcript class forms more specialised subclasses such as primary transcript, processed transcript, tRNA etc. The top class in the model is called the InterMine object class.  Every class in FlyMine is therefore a specialisation of the InterMine object class.</item>  
        <item>Classes in the hierarchy are linked together by references. A reference is a pointer from one class to another class.  For example, The Transcript class has a reference to the exon class as exons are part of a transcript.  A specific object of a class has a reference to a specific object or objects in another class.  For example, there is a reference between the Gene class and the Transcript class. In practise this actually means that individual objects of the Gene class have a reference to specific objects of the transcripts class.  ie. a particular gene object has particular transcripts. When a class has a reference to another class, the referenced class will appear as field within the class. </item>
       <item>Fields can be one of several different data types.  For example some fields simply contain one piece of information, such as a name.  In this case the field is the type 'String' (a String is basically a piece of text that can include letters and numbers).  Similarly, fields that contain just a number will be of the type, integer.   A field that is a reference to another class will be of type 'class'.  Fields that contain a list of objects (or references to objects of a different class) are known as collections.
