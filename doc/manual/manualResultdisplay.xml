      The total number of objects returned by your query is estimated. An estimate is given because, for large queries, only a subset of the total number of objects is initially returned by the query.  This is to improve query run time for large queries.

      <item>From the results page you can save your data to a bag (see <ulink url= "manualSavingdata.xml">Saving bags of data</ulink>) and export your data in various formats (see <ulink url= "manualExportingdata.xml">Exporting data</ulink>).
