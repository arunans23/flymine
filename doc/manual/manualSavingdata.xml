        <para>Data can be saved into 'bags' and stored in your query history.
        To save your data to a bag select the required data and either add it
        to an existing bag or save it to a new bag. Selecting the check-boxes
        next to the column headings will select the entire column for export.
        Alternatively, individual items can be saved by selecting check-boxes
        next to the items. Saved bags of data can be viewed from the History
        page (accessible from the menu bar).</para>

        <para>Saved bags of data can be used to constrain new queries. If you
