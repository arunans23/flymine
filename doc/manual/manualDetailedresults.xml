       collections for that object along with additional information
       such as the GBrowse genome viewer for sequence features. (see
       <ulink url="manualCOF.xml">Classes, objects and fields</ulink>

       <para>The object details page can be accessed from your results
       by clicking on the [details...] links. From this detailed
       results view it is possible to browse the information contained
