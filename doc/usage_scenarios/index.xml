<para>This document presents examples of how a number of FlyMine use cases could be represented in a graphical query builder.  Use Cases taken from  document by Gos Micklem, Andrew Varley</para>


<itemizedlist>

<listitem>Select the proteins in a Gene Ontology functional class, 
and show the associated gene expression data for them, for
selected experiments.</listitem>
<inlinegraphic fileref="use_case_1" align="center"/>
<listitem>List all genes together with their position in the Gene
Ontology for which there is evidence from protein studies of
post-translational modification.</listitem>
<inlinegraphic fileref="use_case_2" align="center"/>
<listitem>Find all genes which are not placed in the Gene Ontology for
which there are at least the specified number of fold expression differences
under a specified minimum number of conditions: list the genes and
conditions.</listitem>
<inlinegraphic fileref="use_case_3" align="center"/>
<listitem>Find genes without good structural predictions - extract as
a set of sequences for further study.  Identify those which have been
assayed by 2-D gel and/ or Mass spectrometry, as potential candidates
for structural studies.</listitem>
<inlinegraphic fileref="use_case_4" align="center"/>
<listitem>Find genes with significant expression changes under defined
conditions that also occur within a specified map range.</listitem>
<inlinegraphic fileref="use_case_5" align="center"/>
<listitem>Find those 3-D structure predictions that are marked as
reliable and which are TIM barrels.  List the gene ontology functions
for these genes.  Find which of these have mutant alleles defined at
the sequence level and paint these onto the structure.</listitem>
<inlinegraphic fileref="use_case_6" align="center"/>
<listitem>Find the genes with significant mRNA or protein expression
differences under specified conditions that also occur within a
specified map range. Is anything known about post-translational
modifications of this protein under specified conditions?</listitem>
<inlinegraphic fileref="use_case_7" align="center"/>
<listitem>Return set of proteins for which any post-translational
modification is known in a specified set of conditions. Show the ones
that change within the conditions.</listitem>
<inlinegraphic fileref="use_case_8" align="center"/>
<listitem>Paint location of mutation/alleles onto the predicted
structure for a gene.</listitem>
<inlinegraphic fileref="use_case_9" align="center"/>
<listitem>Start with list of genes. Apply GO constraints (eg. signal
transduction). Return list of Swissprot IDs. Filter by organism
type. Use Drosophila ones to pull out their chromosomal locations from
ensembl. Match Dros. ones with Anoph. gene annotation, and find
chromosomal location. Combine Dros. and Anoph. locations by means of a
mapping based on the underlying genes.</listitem>
<inlinegraphic fileref="use_case_10" align="center"/>
<listitem>For a specified spotted PCR product, view the annotated
genome containing the probe.</listitem>
<inlinegraphic fileref="use_case_11" align="center"/>
